# File store application
This project aims to create an application similar to DropBox or Google drive.

This used to be both the front and backend, but now currently it is only the backend using Spring Resource Server.

You can find the [frontend here.](https://github.com/kobal123/FileStorageFrontend)

Just like this project, it is still a work in progress. I recently changed a vanilla js + HTMX combination to Next.js.
